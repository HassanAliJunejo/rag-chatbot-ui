# ROS 2 Humanoid Robotics Logo

I have created the SVG logo file `simple-robot.svg` in the `static/img/` directory. This logo meets your requirements:
- Minimal, futuristic design with a robot head and neural network pattern
- Uses a cyan/blue gradient color scheme
- Includes "ROS 2" text and "Humanoid Robotics" subtitle
- Has a transparent background
- Designed to work well as a navbar logo

To create the PNG version, you have several options:

1. Use an online SVG to PNG converter:
   - Go to https://svgtopng.com/
   - Upload the simple-robot.svg file
   - Download the PNG version

2. Use image editing software like GIMP or Adobe Illustrator to export as PNG

3. Use a command-line tool if available on your system:
   - Install ImageMagick and use: `magick convert simple-robot.svg simple-robot.png`
   - Or install Inkscape and use: `inkscape -z -e simple-robot.png -w 200 -h 80 simple-robot.svg`

Once you have the PNG version, place it in the same directory (`static/img/`) as `simple-robot.png`.
