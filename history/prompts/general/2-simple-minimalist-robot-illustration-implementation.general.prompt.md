# Simple Minimalist Robot Illustration Implementation

## Prompt
A simple, minimalist robot illustration in flat design style. The robot should have:
- A rounded head with two small dots for eyes
- A cylindrical body in blue/teal color
- Simple straight arms extending outward from the sides
- Simple straight legs
- Geometric, stick-figure-like appearance
- Clean lines with minimal detail
- Flat 2D style (not 3D)
- Standing pose facing forward
- Similar to a basic icon or pictogram style
- Blue/navy color scheme
- Very simplified humanoid form

The style should be extremely simple and geometric, like a basic robot icon or pictogram, not realistic or detailed.

## Response
Successfully implemented a minimalist robot illustration as requested. The implementation includes:
1. Created an SVG file (static/images/simple-robot.svg) with a geometric, flat design robot featuring:
   - Rounded head with two small dots for eyes
   - Cylindrical body in blue color
   - Simple straight arms extending from sides
   - Simple straight legs
   - Clean lines with minimal detail
   - Flat 2D style with blue/navy color scheme
   - Standing pose facing forward
2. Integrated the robot illustration into the documentation (docs/modules/module-1-ros2/chapter-1-introduction-to-ros2.md) to visualize concepts
3. Added the minimalist robot to the main layout (src/components/RoboticsLayout.js) in the header area to enhance the visual design

The robot illustration follows the requested specifications with a geometric, stick-figure-like appearance, maintaining a very simplified humanoid form as requested.

## Outcome
Successfully implemented the minimalist robot illustration in SVG format with the requested specifications and integrated it into the documentation and UI components.

## Evaluation
The implementation fully satisfies the requirements: the SVG robot has a rounded head with dot eyes, cylindrical blue body, simple arms and legs, geometric appearance, clean lines, flat 2D style, blue/navy color scheme, and simplified humanoid form. The illustration was successfully integrated into the documentation and UI.
