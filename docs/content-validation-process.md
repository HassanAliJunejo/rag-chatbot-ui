### Educational Quality
- [ ] Content is appropriate for the target audience (AI developers, robotics students with basic Python knowledge)
- [ ] Concepts are explained clearly and in a beginner-friendly manner
- [ ] Explanations focus on concepts rather than complex implementations
- [ ] Content avoids heavy math or advanced control theory

### Structure and Format
- [ ] Content follows the Docusaurus-compatible Markdown format

## Review Process
1. Author completes initial draft
2. Self-review using the checklist above
3. Peer review by another contributor
4. Final review by project maintainer
5. Update based on feedback
6. Final validation before publication

## Tools for Validation
- Markdown linter for formatting consistency
- Spell checker
- Readability analyzer
