This directory contains the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system components for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book project.

## Structure

- `ingest/` - Scripts and utilities for ingesting book content into the vector database
- `api/` - REST API endpoints for querying the RAG system
- `db/` - Database schemas and connection utilities
- `prompts/` - Prompt templates for various types of queries and responses

## Overview

The RAG system is designed to allow users to ask questions about the concepts covered in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book and receive contextual responses based on the book content.

This system enhances learning by providing instant access to relevant book content when users have questions about ROS 2, humanoid robotics, or related topics.
